# 2tier-app-aws-with-terraform
### This project is 3rd part of 10weeksofcloudops challenge

### #Week3 Challenge
#### Implement a 2-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform
1. Leverage modules to create reusable and shareable
2. Use variables and data sources to make your code flexible and maintainable.
3. State file should be stored remotely.
4. Security should be kept in mind.
#### Deliverables:
1. Blog and LinkedIn/Twitter posts.
2. Architectural diagram.
3. Github repo with code and readme file.
## Project Details

In this project, we will be creating 2 tier application in AWS using Infrastructure as Code(IAC) tool Known as Terraform as shown above in the architectural diagram. HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account Accesskey and Secretkey.

2. AWS CLI and Terraform Installed in your system

3. Any IDE i.e VS code or Pycharm.
